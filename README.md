# data-analysis-portfolio
A portfolio of the data analyses I have done, sections are split into statistical/experimental analysis and DOE analysis which used JMP.

**This does have significant overlap with my programming skills so please look at that section as well for more!**

## Statistical/Experimental Analysis
### Mixture Design of Molten Salt Synthesis for LiNiO2
**Summary:** Published work centered around a mixture design for molten salts and molten salt synthesis of cathode active materials

### Meta-analysis of scientific literature to identify trends in Niobium as a dopant or coating
**Summary:** Published work examining the use of elemental Niobium (Nb) and Nb-Oxides as a dopant or coating for active cathode materials

### Fox Mulder is a Maniac, but how much so?
**Summary:** A re-watch podcast re-examines the mental state of the main character in X-Files. Using their ratings and categorization, I get to the bottom of how much of menace Mulder is.

### Automated agglomeration size analysis of active material electrodes
**Summary:** A tool used to do image particle size analysis and plotting from SEM data

### Elemental distribution to quantify active material electrode homogeneity
**Summary:** A tool to measure the distribution of cross-sectional SEM-EDS data to determine if there is elemental non-uniformity across the material

### Meta-analysis of solid-state cells to compare performance trends of different formulations
**Summary:** Details under NDA but the work can be described as follows: A new formulation was observed to have a higher failure rate during testing than more established recipes. I was tasked with determining whether, based on available data, whether there was significant different in failure rates between the formulations, whether the failures could be assigned to specific teams with insufficient training, or if there was a time element to the failures (seasonal). It was found that the new formulation did have a significantly higher failure rate than previous formulations. This was presented to management for executive action.

### Fractional Factorial of electrode mechanical strength
**Summary:** Details are under NDA but the work can be described as follows: The mechanical strength of a new formulation once prepared as a coating was extremely weak. I was tasked with adjusting process conditions and measuring the resulting peel strength of the material coatings. Factors included temperature, material loading (mg/cm2), coating speed, and material composition with a response being force needed for a 180 degree peel test. Using a fractional factorial design, key factors were screened and significant factrors were identified. This was presented to management for executive action.
