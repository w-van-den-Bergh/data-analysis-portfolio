# data-analysis-portfolio
A portfolio of the data analyses I have done, sections are split into statistical/experimental analysis and DOE analysis which used JMP.

**This does have significant overlap with my programming skills so please look at that section as well for more!**

## Statistical/Experimental Analysis
### Automated agglomeration size analysis of active material electrodes
**Summary:**

### Elemental distribution to quantify active material electrode homogeneity
**Summary:**

**Link:**

### Meta-analysis of solid-state cells to compare performance trends of different formulations
**Summary:**

**Link:**

### Meta-analysis of scientific literature to identify trends in Niobium as a dopant or coating
**Summary:** Published work examining the use of elemental Niobium (Nb) and Nb-Oxides as a dopant or coating for active cathode materials

### Fox Mulder is a Maniac, but how much so?
**Summary:** A re-watch podcast re-examines the mental state of the main character in X-Files. Using their ratings and categorization, I get to the bottom of how much of menace Mulder is.
